## Key features

- obtaining information about all routers and connected devices in the entire mesh network:
  - connected devices tracking and tagging
  - device connection parameters (frequency, signal strength, guest and hilink devices)
  - name of the specific router to which the device is connected
  - number of connected devices (total and for each individual router)
- Wi-Fi access management:
  - enable/disable/configure the guest Wi-Fi network
  - enable or disable Wi-Fi access control
  - add/remove devices from blacklist/whitelist
  - Wi-Fi access switch per client device
- enabling and disabling access to specific sites
- hardware and firmware version of the primary router
- internet connection details
- uptime of each router
- control of the NFC (OneHop Connect) on each router separately
- control of the Fast Roaming function (802.11r)
- control of the Target Wake Time (reduce power consumption of Wi-Fi 6 devices in sleep mode)
- reboot buttons
- events for connecting, disconnecting, or moving devices over a mesh network
- automatic detection of available functions

As far as I can understand, problems arise with routers designed for the domestic market of China. Unfortunately, I do not have such devices available so that I can try to find out the reasons for this behavior.

## Installation

### Manual

Copy `huawei_mesh_router` folder from [latest release](https://github.com/vmakeev/huawei_mesh_router/releases/latest) to `custom_components` folder in your Home Assistant config folder and restart Home Assistant. The final path to folder should look like this: `<home-assistant-config-folder>/custom_components/huawei_mesh_router`.

### HACS

`HACS` **->** press `EXPLORE & DOWNLOAD REPOSITORIES` button **->** type `huawei mesh router` **->** press `DOWNLOAD` button and follow the instructions.

Or simply click the button below:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=vmakeev&repository=huawei_mesh_router&category=integration)


## Configuration

Configuration > [Integrations](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integrations/) > Add Integration > [Huawei Mesh Router](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=huawei_mesh_router)

By default, Huawei mesh routers use the username `admin`, although it is not displayed in the web interface and mobile applications.

### Advanced options

You can perform advanced configuration of the component after adding it. 
To do this, click on the intergation, and in the tab that opens, click `CONFIGURE`

## Devices tracking

The component allows you to track all devices connected to your mesh network. Each router can provide information about the zone to which all devices connected to it will be assigned (if enabled in the [advanced options](#advanced-options)). [Read more](docs/device-tracking.md)

You can attach one or more tags to each client device in order to be able to use in automation the number of devices marked with a tag, connected to a specific router, or to the entire mesh network. [Read more](docs/device-tags.md#device-tags)
